        <p id="about-txt">I’m an HTML5 game developer who uses game creation as a form of therapy. Diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2020, I found that coding and game design help me channel my creativity and focus. Through my projects, I’m not only honing my skills but also finding balance and purpose. My journey with mental health challenges has shaped my approach to development, and I hope to inspire others by sharing my story and games.</p>
